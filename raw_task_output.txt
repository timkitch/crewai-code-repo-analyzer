This PlantUML sequence diagram represents the flow of data and interactions in the TextRank Web Application. Starting from the user input through the Streamlit UI, it shows how the input is processed by `app.py` using the `ConfluenceQA` component, how documents are reranked in `rerank.py`, and finally, how the results are formatted by `utils.py` and displayed back to the user.
